# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

I'm going to use my final project to make a webcomic page. I do a lot of work with
illustration and comics, and if I ever want to do it professionally it'll be really
important for me to have a webpage where I can host my work and my portfolio.

The biggest part of the project will be a gallery page that can display pages from
a comic, with controls for switching between pages and a comments section underneath
each page. Although this will be the focus, I want the landing page to be separate,
with a simpler design that directs the user to different parts of the site. Aside from
the main comic gallery, I also want a section where I can host sort of a mini-portfolio
with some examples of my other work and contact links to my social media.

My flex goal is to make the comic page comments section more robust, with some kind of basic
username/password functionality that let's users comment with a consistent profile instead
of just anonymously. Ideally there would also be a moderation system that would let me
curate comments too, since this is primarily supposed to be a place that reflects my work
and I wouldn't want a random user blasting slurs on it or something. Because the comments
are meant to be a secondary feature anyway, I don't really expect I'll have time to
work on these aspects but they would be important to add if this became a public site.
